Elimination=A [a:0] cannot exist in a box, row, or column that already contains a [a:0].
RemainingSingle=These cells each have only one possible value left. Therefore, they must be those values.
IsolatedSingle=[c:Green]This cell[c:Black] is the only cell that can contain a [a:0] in [c:Orange]this [a:1][c:Black].
Trap1=All cells in [c:Purple]this [a:1][c:Black] that can contain a [a:0] are in [c:Orange]this [a:2][c:Black].
Trap2=Placing a [a:0] in any other [a:1] in [c:Orange]this [a:2][c:Black] would leave no possible place for [a:0] in [c:Purple]this [a:1][c:Black].
Trap3=Therefore, the [a:0] in [c:Orange]this [a:2][c:Black] must be in [c:Purple]this [a:1][c:Black], and cannot be in any other [a:1].
RemainingDouble1=[c:Blue]These two cells[c:Black] can only contain [a:0] or [a:1] and are in the same [a:2].
RemainingDouble2=Imagine placing a [a:0] in the first cell.
RemainingDouble3=This forces the second cell to be a [a:1], then [c:Orange]all other cells[c:Black] in the [a:2] can be neither [a:0] nor [a:1].
RemainingDouble4=Let us return to the beginning.
RemainingDouble5=Now imagine placing a [a:1] in the first cell instead.
RemainingDouble6=This forces the second cell to be a [a:0], and again, [c:Orange]all other cells[c:Black] cannot be [a:0] or [a:1].
RemainingDouble7=Either way, [c:Orange]all other cells[c:Black] in the [a:2] cannot be [a:0] or [a:1].
IsolatedDouble1=[c:Orange]These two cells[c:Black] are the only cells in [c:Blue]this [a:2][c:Black] that can contain [a:0] or [a:1].
IsolatedDouble2=This means that one of [c:Orange]these cells[c:Black] must contain a [a:0].
IsolatedDouble3=Imagine placing a [a:0] in the first cell.
IsolatedDouble4=The only place left where [a:1] can go in [c:Blue]this [a:2][c:Black] is the second cell. [c:Orange]Both cells[c:Black] become occupied by [a:0] and [a:1].
IsolatedDouble5=Let us return to the beginning.
IsolatedDouble6=Now imagine placing a [a:0] in the second cell instead.
IsolatedDouble7=[a:1] becomes forced into the first cell. Again, [c:Orange]both cells[c:Black] become occupied by [a:0] and [a:1]
IsolatedDouble8=Either way, [c:Orange]the two cells[c:Black] become occupied by [a:0] and [a:1], and cannot be any other number.
TwoByTwo1=In these two [a:1], all possible [a:0]s are restricted to these two [a:2]s.
